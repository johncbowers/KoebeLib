# Koebe-Lib Development Environment

The purpose of this library is to support the creation of geometric constructions in the inversive geometry of circles on the 2-sphere.
The design of the code base was heavily influenced by Sherif Ghali's [Introduction to Geometric Computing](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9781848001145).
This is an excellent reference for anyone interesting in coding a geometric library and gives a good overview of the various design decisions involved.
Ghali also gives plenty of companion C++ code, which we referred to for coding several of the operations on various geometric objects and the structure of the `geometry.primitives` package is in line with Ghali's suggestion for how to structure such libraries.

# App

The code base also has one application (well, there are a few dummy ones that I need to remove/clean up) that is a first version of what I hope will eventually become a [GeoGebra](http://geogebra.org)-like application for inversive geometric constructions.
That is the `SphericalSketch` found in the `sketches` package.
This application loads a little bare-bones Python IDE and 3D view that allows a user to create and visualize geometric constructions on the fly.
Eventually we will post some sample scripts somewhere in this repository.

# Codebase

This is a _very_ alpha-level release.
I'm just getting started with this code base, and have some ideas for applications to build on top of it, but I decided to go ahead and release it, because some others are starting to use the code base and thus there needs to be a public repository.

The codebase is written in Kotlin and is developed in JetBrainâ€™s IntelliJ IDEA.  
There are some weird dependencies, but they are all managed with Gradle and do not need to be retreived manually.

I have also included an ArcBall class that was converted to Kotlin and lightly modified. The

# The dev-environment.

Building and run configuration is all done through Gradle.
For use with IntelliJ IDEA the project should be imported as a Gradle project and built/run using the Gradle tasks.
Debugging through IntelliJ IDEA works as normal for Gradle tasks.
Tasks can be run with a local installation of Gradle, or using the included Gradle wrapper.
To use the wrapper substitute `./gradlew` for `gradle` in the examples below.

### Configuration of run tasks
Configuration options are available in `settings.gradle`  
Run configurations for new main classes can be created there.

## Gradle tasks
Clone the repo. All Gradle tasks are run from the root of the repository.  
View available tasks with the `gradle tasks` command.  
The main tasks to use are described below.

### Compile Kotlin
Run `gradle compileKotlin`  
This compiles the source code with no additional actions taken.  
This can be useful when just checking for compiler errors, but is generally not needed.

### Generate ANTLR Grammar Sources
Run `gradle generateGrammarSource`  
This will run ANTLR to generate source files for grammars in the `src/main/antlr/main` directory.  
The files will be placed in `build/generated-src/antlr/main` if needed for reference. 
This task is automatically run when compiling to make the ANTLR source available to the build.

### Run the application
There are several run configurations available of the form `gradle run<class>`  
Each builds the application and runs their respective main class.

### Build a JAR for distribution
Run `gradle jar`  
A standalone executable 'fat' jar will be built in `build/lib/koebelib.jar`  
This jar should be suitable for distribution as it includes all dependencies.
It can be run with `java -jar build/lib/koebelib.jar`  
The main class is specified in `settings.gradle` or with the `-Pmain=<class>` argument.  

### Cleanup the build directory
Run `gradle clean`  
The build directory will be deleted.

## Using IntelliJ IDEA

1. Clone the repo.
2. Select import project in IntelliJ.
3. Select the `build.gradle` file from the cloned repo.
4. Configure import options.
    - Check 'Use auto-import'.
    - Uncheck 'Create separate module per source set'
    - Select 'Use default gradle wrapper' or 'Use local gradle distribution'
5. Open the Gradle tool window.
    - View > Tool Windows > Gradle
6. Select a run configuration
    - Tasks > koebelib > run\<class\>

**_Disclaimer_**  
Building the application and creating run configurations with IntelliJ's native tools may work.  
It is, however, not supported and is not guaranteed to work in all cases.
